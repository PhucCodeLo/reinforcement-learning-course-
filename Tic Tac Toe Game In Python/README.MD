# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

## 📝 Introduction
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game allows a player to compete against an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves. The graphical interface makes it interactive and easy to play.

## 🔧 Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the Pygame library. Use the following command:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python game.py
   ```
2. The game window will open with a 3x3 grid.
3. **Player ("X")** moves first by clicking on an empty square.
4. **AI ("O")** will automatically make its move after the player.
5. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw.
6. If there is a winner, the result will be displayed, and the game will reset after a short delay.
7. If the board is full with no winner, the game will declare a draw and reset.
